## Deployment Phase

### Pre-Deployment Actions
- [ ] Announce deployment window to team
- [ ] Enable maintenance mode if needed
- [ ] Create database backup
- [ ] Tag release in Git
- [ ] Create deployment branch
- [ ] Verify staging environment matches production

### Deployment Steps
- [ ] Deploy database migrations first
- [ ] Verify migration success
- [ ] Deploy backend services
- [ ] Verify backend health checks
- [ ] Deploy frontend application
- [ ] Verify frontend deployment
- [ ] Clear CDN cache if necessary
- [ ] Run smoke tests

### Immediate Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify health check endpoints responding
- [ ] Check application logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor error rates in Sentry
- [ ] Verify critical user flows work
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Verify database connections
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Check API response times

## Post-Deployment Phase

### Verification (First 15 Minutes)
- [ ] Monitor error rates (should be < 1%)
- [ ] Check response times (p95 < 500ms)
- [ ] Verify user sign-ups working
- [ ] Verify login/logout working
- [ ] Check critical API endpoints
- [ ] Monitor database query performance
- [ ] Verify external integrations
- [ ] Check CDN hit rates

### Monitoring (First Hour)
- [ ] Review application logs
- [ ] Check for memory leaks
- [ ] Monitor CPU usage
- [ ] Verify no unusual spikes in errors
- [ ] Check database connection pool
- [ ] Monitor API rate limits
- [ ] Review security alerts
- [ ] Check user feedback channels

### Extended Monitoring (First 24 Hours)
- [ ] Review daily metrics dashboard
- [ ] Analyze user behavior patterns
- [ ] Check for performance degradation
- [ ] Monitor conversion rates
- [ ] Review customer support tickets
- [ ] Analyze error trends
- [ ] Check resource utilization

### Documentation & Communication
- [ ] Update deployment log
- [ ] Document any issues encountered
- [ ] Update runbooks if needed
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of completion
- [ ] Update status page
- [ ] Post deployment summary to team
- [ ] Schedule post-mortem if issues occurred

## Rollback Criteria

Rollback immediately if:
- Error rate exceeds 5% for 5 consecutive minutes
- Critical functionality broken (auth, payments, core features)
- Database corruption detected
- Security vulnerability exploited
- Response time degradation > 200% from baseline
- More than 10% of users experiencing issues

## Rollback Procedure

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - [ ] Announce rollback decision
   - [ ] Enable maintenance mode
   - [ ] Stop deployment pipeline

2. **Rollback Steps**
   - [ ] Revert frontend deployment
   - [ ] Revert backend deployment
   - [ ] Rollback database migrations if needed
   - [ ] Clear CDN cache
   - [ ] Verify rollback successful

3. **Post-Rollback**
   - [ ] Verify application working normally
   - [ ] Document rollback reason
   - [ ] Schedule incident post-mortem
   - [ ] Update stakeholders
   - [ ] Prepare fix for next deployment

## Performance Benchmarks
