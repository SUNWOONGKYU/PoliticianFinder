## Abstract

This document presents the **Hierarchical Linear Evaluation Method with Bayesian Prior**, a novel evaluation framework designed for fair and transparent political assessment. The method combines Bayesian prior probability theory with linear normalization techniques to eliminate sample size bias while maintaining mathematical rigor and interpretability.

### Key Innovation
Traditional Bayesian approaches use weighted averaging, causing scores to vary based on data volume even when data quality remains constant. Our method employs **linear normalization** to map data totals to a fixed range (¬±3), ensuring that only data quality affects the final score, not quantity.

### Core Components
1. **Bayesian Prior 7.0**: Democratic legitimacy baseline
2. **Linear Normalization**: Data-independent scoring via Min-Max scaling
3. **Multi-AI Assessment**: 5 independent AI engines for bias mitigation
4. **Hierarchical Aggregation**: Mathematically sound multi-level scoring

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Bayesian Prior Probability

#### Definition
In Bayesian statistics, a **prior probability** represents the degree of belief before observing evidence. In our political evaluation context:

```
Prior P(Œ∏) = 7.0 (on a 0-10 scale)
```

This represents the baseline assessment that all elected officials deserve a score of 70/100 points, acknowledging their democratic mandate.

#### Justification
- **Democratic Legitimacy**: Elected officials have won public trust through elections
- **Presumption of Competence**: Public service positions assume baseline capability
- **Neutral Starting Point**: Neither pessimistic (0) nor optimistic (10)

### 1.2 Linear Normalization Theory

#### Min-Max Scaling Formula
```
normalized = (value - min) / (max - min) √ó target_range
```

#### Our Application
```
Evaluation Range: [-10, +10] per data point
Target Range: [-3, +3] deviation from Prior

For N data points:
- Minimum Total: -10N
- Maximum Total: +10N
- Midpoint: 0

Deviation = (Œ£ scores / (10 √ó N)) √ó 3
```

#### Properties
1. **Scale Invariance**: Proportional relationships preserved
2. **Range Guaranteed**: Output always within [-3, +3]
3. **Data Independence**: Result depends only on average, not count
4. **Linearity**: f(ax) = a¬∑f(x) for scaling factor a

### 1.3 Hierarchical Evaluation Framework

Based on **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)** principles:

```
Level 0: Individual Data Points (-10 to +10)
    ‚Üì (Linear Normalization)
Level 1: Item Scores (4 to 10)
    ‚Üì (Arithmetic Mean)
Level 2: Category Scores (4 to 10)
    ‚Üì (Summation)
Level 3: Final Score (40 to 100)
```

Each aggregation step employs mathematically justified operations.

## 2. Mathematical Formulation

### 2.1 Notation

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| N | Number of data points for an item |
| s_i | Individual data score (-10 to +10) |
| S | Total sum of data scores |
| Œ∏_0 | Bayesian Prior (7.0) |
| Œ¥ | Deviation from Prior |
| I_j | Item score for item j |
| C_k | Category score for category k |
| F | Final score |

### 2.2 Core Formula

#### Step 1: Data Collection
```
s_i ‚àà [-10, +10], i = 1, 2, ..., N
```

Each AI engine evaluates data on a symmetric scale:
- +10: Excellent (highly positive)
- 0: Neutral
- -10: Very poor (highly negative)

#### Step 2: Total Sum Calculation
```
S = Œ£(i=1 to N) s_i
```

#### Step 3: Linear Normalization to ¬±3 Range
```
Œ¥ = (S √ó 3) / (10 √ó N)
```

**Proof of Range**:
```
Minimum: S = -10N ‚Üí Œ¥ = (-10N √ó 3) / (10N) = -3
Maximum: S = +10N ‚Üí Œ¥ = (+10N √ó 3) / (10N) = +3
```

#### Step 4: Apply Bayesian Prior
```
I_j = Œ∏_0 + Œ¥ = 7.0 + Œ¥
```

**Range**: [4.0, 10.0]

#### Step 5: Category Score (Arithmetic Mean)
```
C_k = (1/10) √ó Œ£(j=1 to 10) I_j
```

**Range**: [4.0, 10.0] (preserved by averaging)

#### Step 6: Final Score (Additive Model)
```
F = Œ£(k=1 to 10) C_k
```

**Range**: [40, 100]

### 2.3 Multi-AI Integration

For m AI engines (m=5):

```
I_j,final = (1/m) √ó Œ£(ai=1 to m) I_j,ai
```

Where I_j,ai is the item score from AI engine ai.

## 3. Methodological Advantages

### 3.1 Data Independence

**Problem with Traditional Bayesian Weighted Average**:
```
Score = (AI_avg √ó N + Prior √ó W) / (N + W)
```

As N increases, Prior influence decreases, causing:
- 10 data points with average 0.8 ‚Üí Score ‚âà 7.5
- 1,000 data points with average 0.8 ‚Üí Score ‚âà 9.5

**Our Solution**:
```
Score = 7.0 + (average √ó scaling_factor)
```

Result:
- 10 data points with average 8/10 ‚Üí Score = 9.4
- 1,000 data points with average 8/10 ‚Üí Score = 9.4

### 3.2 Transparency

Every calculation step is explicit:
1. Data scores are visible
2. Normalization formula is simple
3. Prior value is fixed
4. Aggregation uses standard operations (mean, sum)

### 3.3 Fairness

- **Equal Weighting**: All items within a category have equal importance
- **Symmetric Scale**: Positive and negative evaluations treated equally
- **No Arbitrary Weights**: Avoids subjective weighting schemes

### 3.4 Robustness

- **Bounded Output**: All scores constrained to valid ranges
- **Outlier Resistance**: ¬±10 caps prevent extreme outliers
- **Multi-AI Averaging**: Reduces individual AI bias

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 AI Evaluation Process

Each of the 5 AI engines (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity):

1. **Receives Context**:
   - Politician name and position
   - Evaluation category (e.g., "Integrity")
   - Specific item (e.g., "Corruption allegations")

2. **Collects Evidence**:
   - News articles
   - Official records
   - Public data
   - Statistics

3. **Assigns Score**:
   - -10 to +10 based on evidence
   - Provides justification
   - Cites sources

4. **Returns Structured Data**:
```json
{
  "title": "Brief description",
  "content": "Evidence summary",
  "score": 8.5,
  "source": "Source reference"
}
```

### 4.2 Scoring Algorithm (Python)

```python
def calculate_item_score(scores, count):
    """
    Calculate item score using Hierarchical Linear Evaluation Method

    Args:
        scores: List of individual data scores (-10 to +10)
        count: Number of data points

    Returns:
        Item score (4.0 to 10.0)
    """
    # Handle no data case
    if count == 0:
        return 7.0  # Default to Prior

    # Step 1: Calculate total sum
    total_sum = sum(scores)

    # Step 2: Linear normalization to ¬±3 range
    deviation = (total_sum * 3) / (10 * count)

    # Step 3: Apply Bayesian Prior
    item_score = 7.0 + deviation

    # Step 4: Ensure bounds (safety check)
    item_score = max(4.0, min(10.0, item_score))

    return item_score


def calculate_category_score(item_scores):
    """Calculate category score (arithmetic mean of items)"""
    return sum(item_scores) / len(item_scores)


def calculate_final_score(category_scores):
    """Calculate final score (sum of categories)"""
    return sum(category_scores)
```

### Calculation for Each AI

**AI 1**:
```
N = 4
S = 8 + 7 + 9 + 8 = 32
Œ¥ = (32 / (10 √ó 4)) √ó 3 = 2.4

```

**AI 2**:
```
N = 3
S = 7 + 8 + 8 = 23
Œ¥ = (23 / 30) √ó 3 = 2.3
Item Score = 7.0 + 2.3 = 9.3
```

**AI 3**:
```
N = 2
S = 9 + 8 = 17
Œ¥ = (17 / 20) √ó 3 = 2.55
Item Score = 7.0 + 2.55 = 9.55
```

**AI 4**:
```
N = 5
S = 7 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 8 = 39
Œ¥ = (39 / 50) √ó 3 = 2.34
Item Score = 7.0 + 2.34 = 9.34
```

**AI 5**:
```
N = 3
S = 8 + 9 + 7 = 24
Œ¥ = (24 / 30) √ó 3 = 2.4
Item Score = 7.0 + 2.4 = 9.4
```

### Multi-AI Average
```
Final Item Score = (9.4 + 9.3 + 9.55 + 9.34 + 9.4) / 5 = 9.40
```

**Result**: This item receives **9.40 points** (Excellent performance)
