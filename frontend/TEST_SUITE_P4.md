- `k6/load-test-stress.js` - Stress testing (up to 150 users)
- `k6/load-test-spike.js` - Spike testing (sudden 200 user spike)
- `k6/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Load Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Load Test**
   - Duration: ~4 minutes

      - run: npm run test:load
```

### Pre-Release Checklist

- [ ] All unit tests passing (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Critical E2E flows verified
- [ ] Security tests passed
- [ ] Performance tests show acceptable metrics
- [ ] No high-priority bugs in test results

---

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. **Unit Tests**: Create `__tests__` folder next to source file
2. **E2E Tests**: Add to `e2e/` directory with descriptive name
3. **Load Tests**: Extend existing K6 scripts or create new scenario

### Test Data Management

- Use mock data for unit tests
- Use fixtures for E2E tests (`e2e/fixtures/`)
- Avoid hard-coded production data
- Clean up test data after E2E tests

### Debugging Failed Tests

**Unit Tests:**
```bash
npm run test:watch -- --verbose
```

**E2E Tests:**
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

**Performance Tests:**
```bash
k6 run --http-debug=full k6/load-test-basic.js
```
